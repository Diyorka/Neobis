To get connection with DB I used class Connection and DriverManager,
I saved my connection data in java class ConnectionData.java
Also I saved table and column names in java class TableColumnNames.java

Insert new data using class Laptop and PrepareStatement
Just used getters and setters and wrote SQL query

Select data using SQL query and PrepareStatement

Change data using SQL query with "WHERE", PrepareStatement

Delete data using SQL query with "DELETE FROM", PrepareStatement



Hope you understand my code :)
